# talk to gpt3 on the phone
With this project, I interface with the TWILIO api. You call a number and GPT-3 answers. You can also use your own presets. Read the code and change it :)
To set up you need to get your own TWILIO number. I can recommend getting one from GB. Then also you need an open ai login to gpt3. Change the credentials in the
code and configure your own preset and you are ready to go.
