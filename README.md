# real-time-translation-on-the-phone
With this project, I interface with the TWILIO api. The idea is that you can add a number to an existing phone call.
Say you want to speak in your own language with somebody else who speaks chinese. So when you add the translator number, 
I could just speak German, and the translator ai repeats that in Chinese. After the other person has heard the translation, answering is as simple as saying what you want to say in Chinese, I will hear the translation in my own language and we can understand each other. 

The project is still in development, I had to pause it as I am working an cofounding an hiring startup at the moment.
So I only managed to make the thing working for two hard coded languages and not all langueages in general.
Also calls are limited at the moment to a certain amount of time.
